graphics-project
=================
This project contains 2 games made using C++ and OpenGL. One project is 2d and the other 3d. The project uses code from the book [Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach with Shader-Based OpenGL 6th Edition](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/).

The projects require [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [Freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) to build.
